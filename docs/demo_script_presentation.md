# üéØ DeFi Autopilot: Hackathon Demo Script & Presentation

## üé¨ **30-Second Live Demo Script**

### **Setup Phase (5 seconds)**
> *[Screen shows dashboard with portfolio]*
> 
> "Here's my DeFi portfolio with $10,000 earning just 3.2% APY on Aave. Like most DeFi users, I'm missing better opportunities."

### **AI Discovery Phase (8 seconds)**
> *[Point to optimization alert appearing on screen]*
> 
> "Watch this - our AI continuously monitors 50+ protocols and just detected Compound offering 7.8% APY. That's a massive 4.6% yield improvement worth $460 extra per year."

### **Cost Analysis Phase (7 seconds)**
> *[Highlight profit calculation panel]*
> 
> "But here's the breakthrough - traditional bridges cost $50+ in gas fees, making this unprofitable. Our XRPL routing executes this for just $3, leaving $457 net profit."

### **Execution Phase (8 seconds)**
> *[Click "Execute AI Rebalance" button]*
> 
> "Executing rebalance via optimized XRPL cross-chain route... [pause 5 seconds] ...Complete! Portfolio now earning 7.8% instead of 3.2%."
